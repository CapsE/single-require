#### Concept
Include single files from web recourses like github.com. Makes it easy to reuse your code without the need to create special packages.

#### Installation
``` 
npm install -g single-require
```

#### Usage
* Create a file with the name of the file you want to include.
* Add the .req file extension to it.
* Write the url of the file you want to include into your file.
* run the "req" command in your console.
